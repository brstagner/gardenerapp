# Gardener

## Overview

This is a Node.js React frontend and Express backend application that gives users a visual interface for planning a flower garden. A user can search for and save plants to a personal list, then place those plants in a virtual garden bed that displays the colors of the flowers that will be blooming in a selected month.

## Setup

Readme files for the frontend and backend can be found in their respective folders.
